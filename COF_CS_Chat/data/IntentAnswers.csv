We’re not able to share new information about an account after we sell it. However, we can make changes if any of our previous updates were inaccurate."

PrimeRate,"The Prime Rate is a benchmark interest rate used by Banco Uno and most other banks to set rates on consumer loan products, such as credit cards. The Prime Rate is based upon, and generally changes with, the Federal Reserve’s Fed Funds Rate. You can find the current Prime Rate in the money rates column of The Wall Street Journal. If your credit card or any other loan has a variable APR based on the Prime Rate, whenever the Prime Rate changes, the variable APR on your account will likely change with it."
APR,"To find the current APR for your account, check the “Interest Charge Calculation” section of your monthly credit card statement, either online or on the statement you receive in the mail."
VarAPR,We calculate a variable APR by adding a margin to the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal. Please check your account details for more information.
APRchange,"If your account has a variable APR based on the Prime Rate, please refer to your monthly account statement for the date of when these changes take effect."
APRdrop,"If the Federal Reserve’s actions lower the Fed Funds Rate, both the Prime Rate and your credit card account’s APR are likely to go down as well."
Intdrop,"Doing the following can help you minimize interest charges: If possible, pay your balance in full to avoid interest charges. Making on-time payments of more than your minimum payment each month will reduce the overall amount of interest you pay."
Minpay,"Your minimum payment includes billed interest charges. So, if the Prime Rate changes, your variable APR changes, and by extension your interest charges and your minimum payment may also change with it."
Clinc,"Some accounts aren't eligible for increased credit lines upon request. Accounts that are usually ineligible: Are new accounts opened within the past several months. Are secured credit cards. Have received a credit line increase or decrease over the past several months.

clincome,"Here’s how to think about what to include: Personal Income: Income you earn, including full-time, part-time or seasonal jobs, self-employment, interest or dividends, retirement, and public assistance. Shared Income: Money from somebody else that is regularly deposited into your individual account or into a joint account that person shares with you. Optional Income: Alimony, child support or separate maintenance income doesn’t need to be included, unless you want it to be considered."
clemp,"For employment status, choose employed, self-employed, retired, unemployed, student or other–whichever is most accurate: Employed: You work full or part time for a company or business you don’t own. Self-Employed: You own a business where you work full-time or part-time. Unemployed: You aren’t currently employed full-time or part-time and don’t own a business, even if you’re collecting unemployment benefits or public assistance. Retired: You no longer work full-time or part-time, but currently have a source of income or are living off of savings or other retirement benefits. Student: You’re enrolled in classes full time (even if you have a full-time job). Other: None of the above apply, or you’re unemployed but do have regular access to income from somebody else."
clexp,"Yes, as long as you are at least 21 years old and that income is regularly used to pay your expenses. If you are under 21 years old, you may only include your own income or income from somebody else if it’s regularly deposited into your bank account or into an account that you share with this person."
clrent,"For your monthly rent or mortgage payment, please enter the amount you pay to your mortgage company or the amount you’re required to pay according to your rental agreement.
